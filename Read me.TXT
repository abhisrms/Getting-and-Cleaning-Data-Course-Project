##Purpose The purpose of this repository is to describe the process of cleaning the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (full description of the dataset can be found here and the data zipfile here). This repository also serves as a fulfillment toward Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

##Content The content of this repository is:

this readme file : README.md
1(one) tidy dataset : tidy.txt
1(one) code book : CodeBook.md
1(one) R script : run_analysis.R
The tidy dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code book (CodeBook.md) explains the variables one by one.

The R script (run_analysis.R) can be run to reproduce the same tidy dataset in this repository. Explicitly, these are the things that the script does:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Puts descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
##Getting the Data In order for you to execute the analysis script, run the following to download the data.

download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip","UCI HAR Dataset.zip", method = "curl")
unzip("UCI HAR Dataset.zip", exdir = ".")
setwd("UCI HAR Dataset/")
Afterward, you can execute run_analysis.R in the working directory.
